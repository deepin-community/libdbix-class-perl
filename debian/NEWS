libdbix-class-perl (0.082810-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Notable Behavior Changes and Deprecations since Wheezy:

    - The emulate_limit() arbitrary limit dialect emulation mechanism is
      now deprecated, and will be removed when DBIx::Class migrates to
      Data::Query

    - Limited checks are performed on whether columns without declared
      is_nullable => 1 metadata do in fact sometimes fetch NULLs from
      the database (the check is currently very limited and is performed
      only on resultset collapse when the alternative is rather worse)

    - Ensure source metadata calls always take place on the result source
      instance registered with the caller

    - find() now throws an exception if some of the supplied values are
      managed by DBIC::FilterColumn (RT#95054)

    - Explicitly deprecate combination of distinct and selecting a
      non-column via $rs->get_column()
